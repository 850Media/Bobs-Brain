# FieldTrain — Detailed Concept

*Idea from Big Mike — 2026-01-28*

## 🎯 The Idea

**Gamified training platform for field workers.**

Companies upload training content → AI creates mobile-friendly quizzes → Field staff compete on leaderboards → Everyone learns without feeling like they're "training."

---

## The Pain Points It Solves

### For Business Owners / Managers
| Pain | How FieldTrain Solves It |
|------|--------------------------|
| Training is expensive | Self-serve quizzes, no trainer needed |
| Creating training content is time-consuming | Upload docs, AI does the rest |
| Hard to track who's trained on what | Dashboard with completion tracking |
| Compliance requires training documentation | Built-in records + certificates |
| Workers forget what they learned | Gamification encourages repeat engagement |

### For Field Workers
| Pain | How FieldTrain Solves It |
|------|--------------------------|
| Training is boring | Gamified, competitive, bite-sized |
| Feel like they're being "tested" | Feels like a game, not a test |
| No recognition for learning | Leaderboards, badges, certificates |
| Training cuts into work time | Mobile, do it during downtime |

## How It Works

### Back Office (Admin)
1. **Upload content** — PDFs, docs, articles, product manuals, SOPs
2. **AI processes** — Extracts key concepts, generates quiz questions
3. **Review/customize** — Admin can tweak questions if needed
4. **Assign to staff** — Push to individuals, teams, or all staff
5. **Track progress** — Dashboard shows completion, scores, trends

### Field Staff (Mobile App)
1. **Get notification** — New quiz available
2. **Take quiz** — Mobile-friendly, quick (5-10 questions)
3. **See results** — Instant feedback, correct answers shown
4. **Check leaderboard** — See ranking vs. peers
5. **Earn certificate** — Download/email upon completion
